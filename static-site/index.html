			<h2>Mangrove CNP Overview</h2>
			<p>Mangroves provide critical habitat for fish and birds and protect our shorelines and coasts. With global
				climate change, mangroves are experiencing stress at an unprecedented rate. A fungal disease, Mangrove
				CNP, has been increasingly found in Floridaâ€™s mangroves, causing die-off events in mangrove nurseries
				and the wild. Mangrove CNP is a disease caused by a group of fungal pathogens: Curvularia,
				Neopestalotiopsis, and Pestalotiopsis. The fungal groups work together to cause disease and death in
				mangroves.</p>
			<p>An example of how Mangrove CNP works in mangroves is chickenpox and shingles in humans. After a human has
				chickenpox, the chickenpox virus lays dormant in the body. The human immune system can fight off the
				virus until a stress event occurs. When the body undergoes stress, the chickenpox virus reactivates and
				causes shingles.</p>
			<p>Mangrove CNP is very similar in nature to chicken pox and shingles. More than 80% of wild mangroves
				sampled by the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the Marine Resources Council (MRC) have tested
				positive for Mangrove CNP. It is apparent that under normal conditions, mangroves can fight off the
				fungal disease. However, if the tree experiences a stress event like high temperatures, flooding,
				transplantation, or storm surge, the fungal disease can become active and cause disease and death. While
				mangroves have adaptations to tolerate salt water, salt is still toxic to mangroves like other plants.
				With rising sea levels, mangroves are being flooded more frequently and for more extended periods of
				time, causing stress. Mangrove CNP can be transmitted easily through the air, water, and by insects.</p>
			<p>Mangrove CNP has been noted globally, but no efforts to treat the disease have been made. Die-off events
				due to Mangrove CNP and other related fungal diseases have been reported in Malaysia, Pakistan, China,
				Australia, Philippines, Colombia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and the US, with the
				earliest known US report being in Miami, FL, in 2019. As mangroves are critical to shoreline health and
				coastal protection, a global effort must be made at disease control and treatment.</p>

				<h2>Mangrove CNP Quick Facts</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The disease affects red, black, and white mangroves.</li>
					<li>Younger mangroves are more severely affected than older mature mangroves.</li>
					<li>The disease affects other coastal and native Florida vegetation like sea grapes,
						buttonwoods,
						and
						crops like corn and strawberries.</li>
					<li>Florida could lose shoreline protection and natural resources if Mangrove CNP becomes
						widespread.</li>
					<li>MagSun is a treatment, not a cure; trees can be reinfected after treatment.</li>

			<h2>Mangrove CNP Research</h2>
			<p>Additional research into Mangrove CNP and MagSun treatment is needed before being able to treat afflicted
				mangroves in the wild. Please consider donating to our research. We are currently looking for $5,000 to
				purchase a nanopore for DNA sequencing.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Donations:</strong>
				Donations to the mangrove nursery and field research can be directed to the Marine Resources Council at
				lovetheirl.org
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Research Funding:</strong>
				To donate to the ongoing lab research on Mangrove CNP and treatment at UCF, please reach out to Lori
				Shuff (<a href="mailto:lori.shuff@ucf.edu">lori.shuff@ucf.edu</a>) and Melissa Deinys (<a
					href="mailto:melissadeinys@ucf.edu">melissadeinys@ucf.edu</a>) at the University of Central Florida.
